# Python-for-new-comers
This is a Python tutorial for beginners with the following features.
free, zero start, complete examples, and based on the latest Python 3 version.

Python is a computer programming language. You may have heard of many popular programming languages, such as C, which is very difficult to learn, Java, which is very popular, Basic for beginners, JavaScript for web programming, and so on.

So what kind of language is Python?

First, let's popularize the basics of programming languages. Any programming language used to develop a program is designed to make the computer work, such as downloading an MP3, writing a document, etc. The CPU of a computer only knows machine instructions, so although different programming languages are very different, they all have to be "translated" into machine instructions that can be executed by the CPU in the end. The amount of code written by different programming languages, for the same job, is also very different.

For example, to complete the same task, C has to write 1000 lines of code, Java only needs to write 100 lines, and Python may only need 20 lines.

So Python is a fairly advanced language.

You may ask, is it bad to have less code? The price of less code is slower operation. A C program takes 1 second to run, a Java program may take 2 seconds, and a Python program may take 10 seconds.

So is it true that the lower level programs are harder to learn and the more advanced programs are easier? On the surface, yes, but advanced Python programming is also very hard to learn at very high levels of abstract computation, so an advanced programming language does not equal easy.

However, for beginners and for accomplishing common tasks, the Python language is very easy to use. Even Google is using Python on a large scale, so you don't have to worry about learning it to be useless.

What can I do with Python? You can do daily tasks, such as backing up your MP3 automatically; you can do websites, many famous websites including YouTube are written in Python; you can do the backend of online games, the backend of many online games are developed in Python. In short, you can do a lot of things.

Of course, there are things Python can't do, such as writing operating systems, which can only be written in C; writing mobile applications, which can only be written in Swift/Objective-C (for iPhone) and Java (for Android); writing 3D games, which is best in C or C++.

If you are a white user and meet the following conditions.

Can use a computer, but have never written a program.
remember the equations and a little knowledge of algebra learned in junior high school mathematics.
want to turn from a programming whiz to a professional software architect.
Can set aside half an hour a day to learn.
Don't hesitate, this tutorial is for you!
